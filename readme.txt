== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Conversion gets stuck on "Uploading file..." =

Make sure you have the maximum file size setting defined. 
The converter will not work on localhost servers, since the web service it uses is unable to access uploaded file.

= How do I make new skin ? =

Create a new folder in `/wp-content/plugins/wp-doctopdf-widget/skins` and name it in any way you would like your new skin to be called. Copy skin.css from default skin into the newly created folder and edit the CSS rules. Add your images if you like.

= Browse button is not working on my website ? =

This plugin uses the latest mootools javascript library, so please make sure you don't have mootools already included in your website, by some other plugin.
